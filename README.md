# WELCOME TO FILMPIC
## This is my personal homepage to showcase my film photographs (and development tehcnics I've learned)
- Deployed to  GitHub Pages: https://jounijoh.github.io/homepage/
- Made with React.js 
- Newest additions coded with TypeScript
- Uses Firebase as storage for images 
- Data fetching for images (on MyImages) from my https://github.com/jounijoh/Filmpic-Back-End projects RESTful API
- As my Back End using MariaDB works only locally for now, data succesfully fetched from there is also sent to Firebase Realtime database to be used remotely.
- So when fetching data, if Back End is not answering, data is fetched from Firebase.
- **Data handling like this is by no means ideal or necessary, but this project works as a playground for me to try, learn, and display different technics.**
